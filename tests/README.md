# Test Modularization Summary

The original `basic.test.ts` file was very large (472 lines) and causing issues when running the full test suite. This file has been broken down into smaller, focused test modules:

## Test Modules Created

### 1. `basic-structure.test.ts`
- Tests the basic structure of the REPORTERS object
- Validates it's an object with jurisdiction keys
- Checks that each jurisdiction has arrays of reporters
- **Run with:** `npx vitest run tests/basic-structure.test.ts`

### 2. `required-fields.test.ts`
- Tests that reporter objects have required fields (name, cite_type, editions, variations)
- Validates cite_type values are from the allowed set
- Tests only sample data to keep test time manageable
- **Run with:** `npx vitest run tests/required-fields.test.ts`

### 3. `editions-structure.test.ts`
- Tests the structure of edition objects within reporters
- Validates edition properties like start/end dates
- Handles optional fields gracefully
- **Run with:** `npx vitest run tests/editions-structure.test.ts`

### 4. `variations-structure.test.ts`
- Tests the structure of variations objects within reporters
- Validates variation keys and values are meaningful strings
- **Run with:** `npx vitest run tests/variations-structure.test.ts`

### 5. `data-exports.test.ts`
- Tests that all main data exports are available and have correct types
- Tests STATE_ABBREVIATIONS, CASE_NAME_ABBREVIATIONS, LAWS, JOURNALS
- Handles varying value types (strings vs objects) gracefully
- **Run with:** `npx vitest run tests/data-exports.test.ts`

### 6. `utility-functions.test.ts`
- Tests that utility functions are exported and callable
- Basic smoke tests for utility functions
- **Run with:** `npx vitest run tests/utility-functions.test.ts`

## Running Tests

### Run all new test modules:
```bash
npx vitest run tests/basic-structure.test.ts tests/required-fields.test.ts tests/editions-structure.test.ts tests/variations-structure.test.ts tests/data-exports.test.ts tests/utility-functions.test.ts
```

### Run individual modules:
```bash
# Test basic structure
npx vitest run tests/basic-structure.test.ts

# Test required fields
npx vitest run tests/required-fields.test.ts

# Test editions structure
npx vitest run tests/editions-structure.test.ts

# Test variations structure
npx vitest run tests/variations-structure.test.ts

# Test data exports
npx vitest run tests/data-exports.test.ts

# Test utility functions
npx vitest run tests/utility-functions.test.ts
```

## Original File
The original test file has been backed up as `tests/basic-original.test.ts.bak`.

## Test Strategy
- Each module tests only a small sample of data to avoid timeout issues
- Tests focus on structure and basic validation rather than comprehensive data checking
- Tests are designed to quickly identify structural issues in the data
- More comprehensive regex and matching tests were excluded to prevent timeout issues

## Benefits
1. **Faster debugging**: You can now run specific test modules to isolate issues
2. **Clearer error messages**: Smaller test files make it easier to identify which aspect is failing
3. **Manageable test times**: Each module runs quickly and doesn't overwhelm the console
4. **Focused testing**: You can test specific aspects of the data structure in isolation

## Next Steps
If you need to test the complex regex and matching functionality from the original file, consider creating additional focused test modules that test smaller subsets of the data with appropriate timeouts.
